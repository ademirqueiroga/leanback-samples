Understanding the internals of the Leanback APIs is sometimes quite tricky, but it's something we, as developers, must do to make sure we're able to create apps that look and behave correctly to our users. In this project we dive deep into the HeadersSupportFragment, which is part of the BrowseSupportFragment, and almost always, the first piece of content users see in an Android TV app. We will learn about its creation, how it behaves, and how we can customize it.

This is a two-part series where we learn how to use the Leanback APIs to implement and customize the transport controls, i.e., media controls and their related content, handle D-Pad key events following Google's Playback controls on TV guidelines, and how you can organize your code without mixing UI and playback logic.
